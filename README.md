# MISP - Malware Information Sharing Platform

In this project, I explored the **MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)**, which is designed to facilitate the sharing of structured threat information among security analysts, malware researchers, and IT professionals. The project includes an overview of MISP, its key functionalities, and practical steps I took to create, manage, and analyze threat intelligence using the platform.

## Objective

- Understand the core features and terminology of MISP.
- Learn how to navigate the MISP dashboard and utilize its tools.
- Gain hands-on experience in creating and managing events within MISP.
- Explore the process of tagging and taxonomy management within MISP.
- Learn how to share and correlate threat information using feeds and taxonomies.

## Skills Learned

- **Threat Intelligence Sharing**: I used MISP to securely share threat data.
- **Event Management**: I created, tagged, and managed threat events.
- **Dashboard Navigation**: I customized and utilized the MISP dashboard.
- **Data Correlation**: I correlated indicators and attributes using MISP's automated features.
- **Feed Integration**: I managed and imported feeds for continuous threat updates.
- **Taxonomy and Tagging**: I applied and managed tags for threat intelligence classification.

## Tools Used

- **MISP**: The primary platform I used for threat intelligence sharing and event management.
- **SIEM**: Security Information and Event Management tools for investigating correlated events.

## Steps

### 1. Room Overview
I began by understanding the overall objectives and prerequisites for using MISP. I familiarized myself with the MISP platform and its importance in threat intelligence sharing.

### 2. Introduction to MISP
I explored what MISP is, its core functionalities, and how it supports various use cases such as malware reverse engineering, security investigations, and fraud analysis.
